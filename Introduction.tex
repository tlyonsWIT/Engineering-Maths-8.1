\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{The basics}
Every .tex file has to have THREE commands: 
1. \documentclass{article} - There are other options besides article, for now this is all we will need.
2. \begin{document} - Everthing after this point is what will eventually appear in your pdf file when you compile.
3. \end{docuemnt} - Every begin command in \LaTeX has to have a matching end command.
That's it, everything else is optional, and there are lots of options!!
\end{document}
